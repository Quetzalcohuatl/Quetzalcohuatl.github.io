title: About me
---
I am a data scientist working in New York City. I mainly program in Python with Jupyter Notebook, but sometimes use R.

In my free time I like to use Kaggle. I also play videogames like Team Fortress 2, but I really love puzzle games. Some of my favorite puzzle games are Stephen's Sausage Roll, Baba Is You, TIS-100, and Spacechem. I also listen to lots of new music, always trying to find something new and great.
